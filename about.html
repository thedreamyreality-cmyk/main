        <p>
          Hi everyone, my name is Sybil and I'm a manifestation and mindset coach and content creator.
          My work involves helping people step into the reality they desire, instantly and effortlessly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Growing up in a deeply religious environment, I believed in God as the creator of reality.
          Later, I discovered astrology and spirituality, so I decided that planets and spirits controlled reality.
          But what I came to understand is something that now guides all of my work: we are not separate from the universe.
          We are connected to everything, and our inner world shapes the reality we experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe human beings learn best through stories. Myths, movies, literature and symbols have always been
          humanity’s way of understanding life, destiny and the self.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the Odyssey to Alice in Wonderland, and even within the pages of the Bible, we find the same truth repeated
          across millennia: reality responds to belief.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many of these stories speak of destiny, but I believe our desires are our destiny.
          We are not meant to follow a script thats predetermined for us, instead we are meant to write one for ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          We spend our lives surrounded by stories, but we fail to realize that the most important story that we encounter
          is the one we tell ourselves about ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          We must create our own mythology. We must become the myth-makers.
